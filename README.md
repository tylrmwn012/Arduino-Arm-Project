# Arduino-Arm-Project

This project utilizes an Arduino board, servos, and potentiometers
to form a functioning arm with 4 pivot points, and a gripper.

The goal of this side project is to expand my knowledge on embedded 
programming, while also dive into a project that can be improved upon
over time.
